first things first:
this is just a repo of random ideas and textures (yeah idk why i made this) so some may be flawed or broken!



welp ideas here we come!

idea 1 level 1: lazer/electric fences that use the ambient current of redstone.
first they will just do dammage to every thing, then i will (maybe) add redstone consumsion,
and then maybe after that player configureableity.

idea 2 level 2: plastic... plastic plastic plastic...
soz i just really liked the plasticraft mod so basicly i would just add plastic then plastic tnt then kevlar armor,
then automated plastic, then rubber, then oil refining and burning... welp im getting ahead of my self. :P


idea 3 level 2: runic dungeons... and lots of loots!
basicly there are dungeons that spawn all around the world with verious weapons armor trinkets baubles,
all that can work togather to make some really intresting setbounses!


idea 4 level 3: verious gunpoweder related items
machienery which allow for blastmineing/ gunpowder manufacture/ grinders/ rf generation/ ore refining!
