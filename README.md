first things first:
this is just a repo of random ideas and textures (yeah IDK why I made this) so some may be flawed or broken!



welp, ideas here we come!

idea 1 level 1: laser/electric fences that use the ambient current of Redstone.
first they will just do damage to everything, then I will (maybe) add Redstone consumption,
and then maybe after that player configurable.
adding onto that, maybe tesla coils which shock mobs around them,
maybe if I become a wizard I would add slab versions of the fences/and diagonal versions. 

idea 2 level 2: plastic... plastic plastic plastic...
soz I just really liked the plasticraft mod so basically I would just add plastic, then plastic TNT, then kevlar armor,
then automated plastic, then rubber, then oil refining and burning... welp I'm getting ahead of myself. :P


idea 3 level 2: runic dungeons... and lots of loots!
basically there are dungeons that spawn all around the world with various weapons armor trinkets baubles,
all that can work together to make some really interesting set bonuses!


idea 4 level 3: verious gunpoweder related items
machienery which allow for: blastmineing, a multiblock structure that blasts stuff below it.
 gunpowder manufacture, a mixing device that carefully combines sulfur which you get from ghasts in the nether, salt peater which you get from chicken poop, and coal powder! grinders, that allow for an example grinding coal, ores and other stuff with gunpowder blasts. rf generation, some sort of piston/rotary mechanisum that runs off of gunpowder.


idea 5 level 3: lasers, basically they allow for auto killing of mobs, fences around areas, entity detectors, ore mining, ore melting, and much much more! (yeah thats all i can think of for nowâ€¦)
